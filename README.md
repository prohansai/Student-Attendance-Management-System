# Student-Attendance-Management-System
This project is a simple console-based application written in C that helps manage student attendance in a class. It allows you to track the attendance of students, display individual attendance records, identify students with low attendance, and manage the student roster.

Features:
*Add Students: Add new students to the class by providing their name and roll number. The newly added student will have their attendance records initialized.

*Remove Students: Remove a student from the class roster by providing their roll number. This is useful for managing the list of students effectively.

*Take Attendance: Record attendance for students over multiple days. For each day, you can mark each student as present or absent.

*View Attendance: Display the attendance record of a specific student by entering their roll number. The system provides the total number of classes attended, total classes held, and the attendance percentage.

*Identify Low Attendance: Display a list of students whose attendance percentage is below 75%. This helps identify students who may need to improve their attendance.
